== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q. Why qTip 1.0? Hasn't it been superseeded by qTip2?**

I needed to have the original JR qTip for WordPress plugin run on WordPress 3.x for an upgraded site.
As the plugin hadn't been upgraded in over 2 years and I saw no immediate replacement, I went ahead
and upgraded the plugin to work on the latest (3.5) WordPress.
