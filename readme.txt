== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q. Why qTip 1.0? Hasn't it been superseeded by qTip2?**

I needed to have the original JR qTip for WordPress plugin run on WordPress 3.x for an upgraded site.
As the plugin hadn't been upgraded in over 2 years and I saw no immediate replacement, I went ahead
and upgraded the plugin to work on the latest (3.5) WordPress.

But wait, this release has preliminary support for qTip2! I'll be lookng at qTip2 and see what I can add.
You can continue to use qTip1, I'll provide backwards compatibility for the foreseeable future.
Expect support for shortcodes at somepoint as well.
